> This is a simple React app that counts down from the set amount of work time. When the work time is up the break time starts and so forth until it is stopped or reset.

1. You can set the work time under **Session Length** up to a maximum of 60 minutes.
2. Likewise, the break time can be set under **Break Length** up to 60 minutes.
3. You can use the controls at the bottom of the page to control the timer with play/pause, and reset.
