## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was one of my first projects in React and I learned a lot using the React framework. This project really solidified my understanding of the React framework and I became very comfortable using it.

### Continued development

For future projects I would very much like to continue working with React and further improve my skills in web development.
